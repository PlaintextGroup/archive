          <li>Open Data encourages greater citizen participation in government by providing citizens with the raw
            materials they need to engage their governments and contribute to the improvement of public services. Open
            data is necessary but not always sufficient for citizen participation as in many cases data literacy is
            necessary. See generally “Starting an Open Data Initiative.” The World Bank, May 13, 2021. <a

            Data 500 which is the first comprehensive study of U.S. based companies that use open government data as a
            key business resource. See “How to Make Open Government Data More Relevant, Accessible, and Actionable?”

          <li>Open data used by researchers can lead to groundbreaking research and insights that inform
            decision-making. However, there are instances where closed or classified data can also inform effective
            decision-making (i.e., national security data). See generally “Open Government.” Data.gov, September 18,

          <li>Kenneth R. Dahl, Colonel, U.S. Army writes ‘The federal government has archaic, vertical, “stove-pipe”
            organizational structure and processes that severely undermine success in operations and policy
            implementation. We are unable to achieve unity of effort and a whole-of-government approach to devising
            solutions to critical problems.’ See Dahl, Kenneth R. “New Security for New Threats: The Case for Reforming
            the Interagency Process.” The Brooking Institution, July 2007. <a
